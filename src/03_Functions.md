# Building Programs

> _"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."_<sup><a href="#References">1</a></sup>

## Functions

So far, we explored some of the _"building blocks"_ (the fundamental parts) of programming, this chapter introduces the _"combining parts"_
of programming. In order to build up the solution to a problem the building blocks are combined together into larger and larger forms until,
finally, a useful whole is produced.

The "combining parts" of programs are called "functions". These are equivalent to mathematical functions but we will not use any more
mathematical analogies here. Functions can be _defined_, _applied_ (or _used_, _called_), or _composed_.

### Exercise 3-1: Computational thinking

Describe, using plain natural language, how to draw a triangle. Try to break down your instructions into simpler parts and notice the potential ambiguities.
Also notice that the _ordering_ of instructions is important. If possible, use these instructions on a friend.

---

## Function Application

You can think of a function as a mystery box. At the top is an opening for you to put things into it. The mystery box transforms anything you put into it
and out the bottom it produces the transformed object.

![Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/191px-Function_machine2.svg.png)

The inputs to a function can be a variety of things (some of which we've seen already): a string, a number, even another function, a mouse press, a video
stream, signals from a sensor, a file containing sequence data, ...

We've already been using some built-in Python functions, for example **abs()** or **len()**. As you've already seen, in Python you _apply_ a function
by typing its name followed by an open parenthesis '(', followed by the argument list, and finally a closing parenthesis ')'.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
abs(-56)
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
len("hello")
```
:::

These functions take a single argument. Here is one that takes a list of several arguments.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
print(True, "A string", 55)
```
:::

## Function Definition

We can also build (or _define_) our own functions. When you're writing your own function, start with the _keyword_ `def` like so:

> ```python
> def name_of_my_function(some, function, arguments):
>     # Some operations
>     
>     return result
> ```
The final part of a function is `return` which _specifies what the function evaluates to_ when you apply it. This function
has `3` arguments called `some`, `function`, and `arguments`. 

Let's write our own function to compute the square of a number. This function takes a single integer argument and returns
that number squared. Notice that I have included a type annotation on the argument.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
def my_square(number: int):
    return number ** 2
```
:::

Notice that, when you run this cell, nothing seems to happen. This only _defines_ the function. It has not yet been run or applied.
Think of this as telling Python about your function like you would do with a variable. It might be helpful to imagine Python has a notebook
where it writes down the names of all the definitions it knows about. When you `def` a new function, Python writes that name down in its notebook.

This new function can now be applied (using matching opening- and closing parenthesis) as you have already seen:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
my_square()
```
:::

üò± `TypeError: my_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number'`

What does that mean? It means `my_square()` expects `1` argument, but we gave it `0` arguments. Let's fix that:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
my_square(-5)
```
:::

Because this is a `TypeError` we know that functions also have a type! You caneven annotate the _type_ of the return value like so:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
def my_square(number: int) -> int:
    return number ** 2
```
:::

The _type_ of `my_square` is a _function_ that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer.

## Function Arguments

When you apply a function to some arguments you can also say that the arguments are "_passed_" to the function. You can
think of this as dropping the number `7` into the mystery box labaled `my_square`. So what happens to arguments when
they're "passed" to a function? Where do they come from? And where do they go? Let us try to build an intuition.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# We apply the my_square() function to some argument
my_square(7) # Python then goes off to find the my_square() function
# Found it! It looks like this: my_square(number: int) -> int:
# Python then places the value 7 that we passed into a variable or box called number
# that only the body of my_square can see
```
:::

You can think of function arguments as variables that are assigned on function application.
In order to understand what happens, we can now _substitute_ the name "my_square" with
the function body in the definition of `my_square`:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
number = 7 # Argument passed to the my_square function
number ** 2 # Body of the my_square function
```
:::

Since we know that `number` is defined to be `7`, we can _substitute_ the name "number" with
the definition: `7`:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
7 ** 2
```
:::

Finally, we're left with a mathematical expression that Python can trivially evaluate.


What we just did together is use a _metal model_ of how Python evaluates programs which is known as
the "substitution model of execution"<sup><a href="#References">2</a></sup>, though it is an imprecise
model in this case it will get you a long way.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# This mental model also works for passing variables as arguments:
my_var = 7
my_square(my_var)
# Once again, Python places the value in the "my_var" box into the variable or box called nnumber.
```
:::

The next substitution step is to replace everywhere we see the name "my_var" with its definition: `7`.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# 7 = 7  Initial variable assignment
my_square(7)
```
:::

Next, replace the name "my_square" with its definition.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
number = 7 # Argument passed to the my_square function
number ** 2 # Body of the my_square function
```
:::

And proceed as above.

### Exercise 3-2: Function arguments
Try to guess what will be printed before executing the cell.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
a = len("hello")
b = "blob"
c = len(b)
d = my_square(c)

print(a, b, c, d)
```
:::

---

## Help

Python comes with an in-built documentation system that you can access using a function called `help()`.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
help(abs)
```
:::

The message for our own `my_square` function is not very useful though:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
help(my_square)
```
:::

In order to make the help message for our function more useful we have to slightly _change the definition_ of `my_square`
to include a _docstring_. If you put a string on the line immediately after the name of your function, this string will
be included in the help message for you.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
def my_square(number: int) -> int:
    """Compute the square of the input number."""
    return number ** 2
```
:::

Now check the help message.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
help(my_square)
```
:::

## Indentation
Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to group code into _blocks_. Though this is not a
unique characteristic of Python, although other programming languages you may've used often use curly _braces_ (`{}`) for
this purpose. 

There are 2 things to keep in mind about indentation:

1. The _indentation level_ (which "sub-block") you are in. You have to be careful how you indent the code so that your
   code is correctly grouped into blocks.
2. Consistently indenting code _within_ a block. 

See what happens if indentation is inconsistent:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# This is the "top-level"

def start_of_a_block():
    # This is the beginning of an indented block of code. Note the space at the beginning of the line
   a_variable = 0
    another = 6
```
:::

---

### Exercise 3-3: To return or not to return?
In general your function should evaluate to some value using the `return` keyword. What happens if
you forget to use a `return`? What happens if you `return` with no value?

::: {.cell .code}
```python
def a_function():
    6
    # Solve the exercise here

print(a_function())
```
:::

## Testing
You are probably very confident that the code you've written so far is "correct". But as you write more
complicated programs you will probably begin to feel less confident. Testing, among other virtues, allows
you to keep this early confidence in the correctness of your programs. One (rather na√Øve) way of testing
is to assert an expectation about the state of your program. With Python, this can be achieved using the
keyword **`assert`**. For example, I could test the `my_square` function like so:

::: {.cell .code}
```python
assert 0 == my_square(0)
assert 1 == my_square(1)
assert 4 == my_square(2)
```
:::

Successfully passing these tests will result in no output at all. Failing will result in
**`AssertionError`** with no description of what went wrong.

![Testing](images/testing.png)

Your tests become more useful when they check both expected values and unexpected (edge-case) values.
If your function expects numbers, does it cope well with very large numbers? What about very small numbers?
What about negative numbers? What about zero?

### Testing example

Here I will demonstrate solving an exercise and ensuring the test cases pass

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# Write a function definition here

# These are _test cases_
assert 3 == my_example_function(1, 2), "I expected 3, but got " + str(my_example_function(1, 2))
assert 0 == my_example_function(-51, 51), "I expected 0, but got " + str(my_example_function(-51, 51))
assert my_example_function.__doc__ is not None, "You should write a docstring for your function"
```
:::

---

### Exercise 3-4: Testing

How would you test the following function. Write some tests, try to discover a bug.
You're seeing the syntax for annotating the _return data type_ of a function here for
the first time. It's the arrow between the closing parenthesis and the colon. So this
function accepts a `float` parameter and returns a `float`.

::: {.cell .code}
```python
def fractional_part(number: float) -> float:
    """Find the fractional part of an input floating point number."""
    int_part = int(number) + 1
    frac_part = int_part + number
    return int_part

# Write your tests here
```

## Chapter Review
In this chapter you learned how to write code that simplifies the task of understanding a program by
_abstracting away_ details. Functions are a fundamentally important part of programming, indeed they're
the other half of programming. Functions even correspond to mathematical proofs<sup><a href="#References">3</a></sup>!
You have now covered _all_ of the very fundamentals of programming. You've understood the building blocks.
And now you've understood the combining of things together using function definition and application.

If you are new to programming then it is very likely this will seem overwhelming. Learning to program
requires you to understand many new concepts. It is ok if you feel overwhelmed, the remaining chapters
are here to help you practise. In some sense they are just more details of what we have already covered<sup><a href="#References">4</a></sup>.

### Review Questions

1. What is a function?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    A <em>function</em> is a block of re-usable code with a name, that can be called using that name.
</details>

2. What is the result of evaluating a function called?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    The <em>return value</em>. Or the value <em>returned by the function</em>.
</details>

3. What are docstrings? How do you access them?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    Docstrings are documentation that can be accessed using the <code>help()</code> function.
</details>

4. What is meant by "function application"?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    Function application is synonymous with function "call" or "use". A function is applied to its arguments (or arguments are "passed" to the function) and evaluated to produce results.
    In Python, the function application operator is <code>()</code>.
