Python syntax requires that you put a colon : after the **if**, and that the *block* of code that is conditional is *indented* with the same amount of spaces (or tabs). Python doesn't really care about the number of spaces or tabs, as long as you're consistent. Jupyter notebook uses tabs, hence it is best to follow along. Now try this:"
