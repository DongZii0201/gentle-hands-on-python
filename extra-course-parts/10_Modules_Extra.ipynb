    "We know how to make functions, but how can you re-use them? Imagine that you've started writing code and functions in one file and the project has grown to such an extent that it would be easier to maintain it in different files each containing a specific part of the project. Or you want to re-use some of the functions in other projects as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you can import functions and chunks of code from files. Such a file containing the functions is called a *module*. Generally we say that we import a *definition* from a *module*. A module can have one or multiple functions in it. \n",
    "The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the code from this module is possible by using **import**. In this way you can import your own functions, but also draw on a very extensive library of functions provided by Python (built-in modules). In this extra sections part we will look at the syntax for imports and how to import your own functions."

    "## 10.2 How imports work\n",
    "The easiest way to import a module looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that in the module `module1`, there is a function called `getMeanValue()`. This way of importing does not make the name of the function available; it only remembers the module name `module1` which you can than use to access the functions within the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module1\n",
    "module1.getMeanValue([1,2,3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3 How to create your own module\n",
    "The easiest example is importing a module from within the same working directory. Let's create a Python module called `module1.py` with the code of the function `getMeanValue()` that we have written earlier (and you can find here below). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a module in Jupyter Lab/Notebook**\n",
    "- In order to create a module in Jupyter Lab, first create a new notebook \n",
    "- Rename the notebook (e.g. 'module1.ipynb') and copy paste the code in the notebook \n",
    "- Click 'File', 'Download as' and 'Python' \n",
    "- Jupyter will not download it in some local folder, copy it to your current working directory (in our case in the same directory as we're in right now). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Jupyter Lab/Notebook doesn't have a streamlined & straightforward way of creating Python modules and Python scripts. When you export the notebook, it will always export the whole Notebook and not just a part of it, which makes it very messy if you have a very large notebook. \n",
