# Gentle Hands-on Introduction Programming

Teaching materials for the course. This course is intended to help new
programmers find their feet and begin them on their journeyto writing
useful programs.

## Outline

1. _Introduction_: We begin with [Hedy](https://hedy.org), a _gradual_ introduction to programming. This
   aids in learning to think computationally. But also builds confidence and provides quick
   feedback between writing a program and seeing outp[ut on the screen. Finally, it motivates
   syntax (especially for strings).
2. Data types: introduces the concept and value of types and the Python syntax for data type annotations.
3. Functions: introduces functions as an abstraction for program design and construction.
   Testing is also covered. This chapter forms the final theoretical foundation for the course.
4. Decisions: `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
5. Collections: lists, operations on lists, `in`.
6. Loops: `for`-each loops over lists, stings, and `reange()`.
7. Dictionaries: associating data, looping, slicing, and other operations.
8. Input and output: dealing with the outside world. Data cleaning and some common
   file formats in bioinformatics, such as csv and fasta, are covered.
9. Plotting: a teaser for more advanced topics.
