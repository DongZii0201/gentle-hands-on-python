    "To read in a file you have to create a *file handle*. This is a sort of connection to the file that you can use to pull data from it. You create a connection to a file by using the **open()** function. Whenever you're done using the file, it's good practice to close the file handle. "

    "- `readlines()` - read all of the lines in the file. Each line is one string. The lines are combined as a list of lines (strings). \n",

    "Each method has its advantage. E.g. if you're searching for the presence of a word or string in a file, given that the file is not too big, you can use *read*. If you want to process an enormously big file and from each line you need to extract, process and save the information, than it's better to read line by line with *readline* within a for-loop.
