**James**: Hello and welcome to the Gentle Hands-On Introduction to Python Programming course presented by VIB and Elixir Belgium. My name is James...

**Nina**: and my name is Nina. Together, James and I will guide you on the beginning of your journey into the amazingly useful world of programming.

**James**: We will use a programming language called Python for most of this course. But we will start by introducing you to the fundamental concepts of programming and computation. After this we will discover useful aspects of the language by building useful programs.

**Nina**: Before we start, please make sure you have followed the setup instructions. If you have decided to use VSCodium please start it and open the "chapter 1" notebook. Alternatively, if you have chosen to use Google Colab please open the "chapter 1" notebook there. If you have any difficulties please contact your instructor.

**James**: These tools provide a programming environment for you which you will use for the majority of this course. Rest assured these are professional tools used by professional programmers to write real programs. They are not "toys". They are, however, very useful for experimentation which is very important while you are starting out.

**Nina**: To ensure everything is set up correctly you should open a new "cell" in the notebook and type in an expression.

**James**: So what just happened?

**Nina**: I wrote a very short program, that is the text displayed in the cell here. This is programming. When I clicked on the evaluate button the computer performed the computation required to evaluate my program and displayed the result.

**James**: Kind of like when we were small children. Our parents would ask us simple questions like, "What is 3 + 2?". We would count off on our fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Finally we would say, "5". Our parents programmed and we computed.

**Nina** (looking into the camera): You should try this yourself. Try to write out instructions for making your favourite hot or cold drink. Be as detailed as possible. When you're satisfied ask a friend to follow the instructions as closely as possible without making any assumptions. How far did they get? Did you make any mistakes?

**James**: Pause the video now and attempt the exercise.

**James**: This is the end of the first lesson. You should have some understanding of the structure of the course and what we will cover. You have also learned about what it is to program and to compute. You have discovered that programs are a sequential ordering of steps that must be unambiguous to a computer.

**Nina**: In the next video we will begin using the Hedy programming environment to build some real programs.
