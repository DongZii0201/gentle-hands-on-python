**James**: In this video we will discuss a concept known as _values_. If you completed at least the first 4 levels of Hedy you will be familiar with _text values_. What programmers call _strings_.

**Nina**: It is very likely that you will need other _data types_ too. Such as numbers to represent measurements and logical values to represent... logic.

**James**: `"Hello world"`, `5`, `6.7`, `True` are all examples of _values_.  In order to do anything useful, values can be combined in various ways.

:::success
:movie_camera: Fade to a blank notebook and open a new cell.
:::

**Nina**: For example, strings can be combined using the _concatenation operator_.

:::success
:movie_camera: Concatenate 2 strings in the new cell.
:::

**Nina**: Integer numbers can be combined with arithmetic operators.

:::success
:movie_camera: Compute module division in a new cell.
:::

**Nina**: By experimenting yourself, can you identify what this (`%`) operator does?

:::warning
:notes: Waiting music
:::

**James**: So that operator (`%`) computes the remainder after division, or _modulo division_. What about addition? Since we already used the `+` operator for string concatenation, what can I use to add numbers together?

**Nina**: You can use the `+` operator too. It behaves differently depending on the data types of its 2 operands. If the operands are strings `+` will concatenate them. If the arguments are numbers then if will compute the sum of those 2 numbers.

**James**: (looking into the the camera) And what if 1 operand is a string and the other is a number? Try yourself to find out...

:::success
:movie_camera: Type `"Hello" + 5` into a new cell
:::

**Nina**: (After a pause) There are no sensible ways to combine these data types so Python tells us there was an error. Reading carefully it is a `TypeError`. This helps us understand that the problem with our program has something to do with the way we are using data types.

**James**: Ok so I have to make sure I use the correct operand data types for the operator I want to use. We've talked about arithmetic and concatenation operators. What if I want to compare values?

**Nina**: Python provides several comparison operators that we will use throughout this course. For example, if you want to compare the lengths of 2 strings...

:::success
:movie_camera: Type `len("ATTC") == len("GTTC")` into a new cell
:::

**James**: `True` is one of the logical values you mentioned earlier.

**Nina**: You can think of the equality operator (`==`) as asking a question: "Are my 2 operands the same"?

**James**: So `True` means "Yes" and `False` means "No".

**Nina**: (To the camera) You should experiment with the comparison operators now.

**Nina**: Let's talk about a more realistic problem you might want to solve.

**James**: Alright. I want to use the Mendelion model of genetics to compute the expected number of offspring from a population displaying the dominant phenotype in the next generation. There are 6 possible genotype pairings:

:::success
:movie_camera: Display a slide with the following info on it (animate for each genotype pairing)
:::

1. `AA-AA` has a 100% change of passing on the dominant phenotype
2. `AA-Aa` has a 100% chance of passing on the dominant phenotype
3. `AA-aa` has a 100% chance of passing on the dominant phenotype
4. `Aa-Aa` has a 75% chance of passing on the dominant phenotype
5. `Aa-aa` has a 50% chance of passing on the dominant phenotype
6. `aa-aa` has a 0% chance of passing on the dominant phenotype

**James**: There are 100 couples and I assume each couple produces 2 offspring.

:::success
:movie_camera: Display a slide with the following info on it (animate for each genotype pairing)
:::

* 13 `AA_AA` genotype couples
* 4  `AA_Aa` genotype couples
* 42 `AA_aa` genotype couples
* 14 `Aa_Aa` genotype couples
* 26 `Aa_aa` genotype couples
* 1  `aa_aa` genotype couple

**James**: So I can now compute the expected number of offspring like so...

:::success
:movie_camera: Display this typing into a notebook cell:
```python
(1.0 * 13 + 1.0 * 4 + 1.0 * 42 + 0.75 * 14 + 0.5 * 26 + 0.0 * 1) * 2
```
:::

**James**: Ok this seems to work. But if I come back to this tomorrow I might not remember what it is supposed to do or mean. How can I make my intentions more clear?

**Nina**: There are a few things you can do. Firstly, this might be a good place to write a natural language description of your intentions.

**James**: Ok...

:::success
:movie_camera: Display this typing into a notebook cell:
```python
Compute the expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype
```
Show that a `SyntaxError` happens when executing the cell.
:::

**Nina**: Unfortunately Python doesn't understand natural language so we have to tell Python to ignore this text. You can do that by placing a `#` sign at the beginning of your text.

:::success
:movie_camera: Display this typing into a notebook cell:
```python
# Compute the expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype
```
Show that the cell executes again.
:::

**Nina**: You can make your intentions even more clear by giving the variables meaningful names like this...

:::success
:movie_camera: Display this in a notebook cell:
```python
# Compute the expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype
AA_AA = 13
AA_Aa = 4
AA_aa = 42
Aa_Aa = 14
Aa_aa = 26
aa_aa = 1
offspring = 2
(1.0 * AA_AA + 1.0 * AA_Aa + 1.0 * AA_aa + 0.75 * Aa_Aa + 0.5 * Aa_aa + 0.0 * aa_aa) * offspring
```
Show that the cell still executes correctly.
:::

**James**: That is definitely more clear. And I can use variables the same way as I use values.

**Nina**: Exactly! You can think of the equals sign, which we will call the _assignment operator_ from now on, as placing a value into a box. You can use the box anywhere you want to use the value inside it. And it has a name allowing you to understand what it means.


**James**: In this video we've learned about values and operators to work with values. We have also talked about making computations clearer with comments and variables.

**Nina**: These are the "building blocks" of our programs. In the next lesson we will discuss another basic programming concept which will allow us to "glue" these building blocks together into larger blocks.
