    "Sometimes you will want to represent your variables in text, for example to `print()` or save to a file.\n",
    "You might be tempted to do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_number = 10\n",
    "my_text_representation = \"My computation resulted in: \" + str(my_number) + \" units.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this quickly becomes unwieldy and hard to read. Thankfully, Python gives us an easy way to solve this, the so-called \"f-string\":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_number = 10\n",
    "my_text_representation = f\"My computation resulted in: {my_number} units.\"\n",
    "#                        ^                             ^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "```\n",
    "I've highlighted the changes to the first example: an `f` before the first quote and the variable you want in the text surrounded by braces. This may not look like much of a change or very useful (yet), but you'll quickly run into the limitations of the first approach."
