# Project Ideas

* k-means image segmentation to identify cells from flourencence microscopy images
* Compare data compression methods on sequence data
  - RLE
  - Dictionary
  - Huffman codes
* Decode a BMP image (maybe chest xray)
  - Ref: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
* Plot a 3D protein structure by reading PDB data
* Shakespeare text statistics
  - number and frequency of unique words
  - total number of words
  - character mentions
  - Ref: https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/statistics/
* Find prime numbers
  - Implement a naive algorithm
  - Implement Sieve of Eratosthenes
* Image histogram equalisation
  - Take an image that has barely any detail and ENHANCE!
* Build/draw a phylogenetic tree
  - Given some (real) input sequences
  - Iterative MSA
  - hierarchial clustering
