    "## 3.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we explored some of the _\"building blocks\"_ (the fundamental parts) of programming, this chapter introduces the _\"combining parts\"_ of programming. In order to build up the solution to a problem the building blocks are combined together into larger and larger forms until, finally, a useful whole is produced. This \"useful whole\" is what we call a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Functions\n",
    "The \"combining parts\" of programs are called \"functions\". These are equivalent to mathematical functions but we will not use any more mathematical analogies here. Functions can be _defined_, _applied_ (or _used_, _called_), or _composed_. We will see examples of each in this chapter.\n",
    "Programs are also functions. They consume inputs (also known as arguments) and produce outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/191px-Function_machine2.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to a function can be a variety of things (some of which we've seen in the previous chapter), another function, a mouse press, a video stream, signals from a sensor, a file containing sequence data, ...\n",
    "A function _transforms_ its input to produce its output which can be combined with other functions to build up a whole program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been using some built-in Python functions, for example **print()** or **len()**. As you've already seen, in Python you _apply_ a function by typing its name followed by an open parenthesis '(', followed by the argument list, and finally a closing parenthesis ')'. In this section we will build (or _define_) our own functions. When you're writing your own function, start with the _keyword_ `def` like so:\n",
    ":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name_of_my_function(some, function, arguments):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Some information about the function\"\"\"\n",
    " \n",
    "    result = some + function * arguments \n",
    "    \n",
    "    return result \n",
    "```\n",
    "The final part of a function is `return` which specifies what the function evaluates to. This function has `3` arguments called `some`, `function`, and `arguments`. The string immediately after\n",
    "the definition is called the _docstring_ and is what the `help()` function prints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write our own function to compute the square of a number. This function takes a single numeric argument and returns that number squared."

    "1. What is a function?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    A <em>function</em> is a block of re-usable code with a name, that can be called using that name.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the result of evaluating a function called?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    The <em>return value</em>. Or the value <em>returned by the function</em>.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are docstrings? How to you access them?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    Docstrings are documentation that can be accessed using the <code>help()</code> function.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is meant by \"function application\", how is this different from \"function composition\"?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    Function application is synonymous with function \"call\" or \"use\". A function is applied to its arguments and evaluated to produce results. Function composition is the combining of several functions together to make a new \"thing\" that may be applied later.\n",
