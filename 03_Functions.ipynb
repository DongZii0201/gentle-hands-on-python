    "In the previous chapter we explored some of the \"arithmetic\" or programming (the fundamental parts), this chapter introduces the \"algebra\" of programming or how to combine the different fundamental parts into a useful whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So far we've been writing 'sequential' code, basically following the flow of the code from the top to the bottom of the program. Sometimes, however, you want to re-use code elsewhere without copy/pasting. You can do this with functions; a function holds a block of code that can be called from other places. Functions are essential for larger projects and code maintenance - if there's a problem with that piece of code, for example, you only have to fix it in one place.\n",

    "A function _transforms_ its input to produce its output which can be combined with other functions to build up a whole program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been using built-in Python functions, for example **print()** or **len()**. As you've already seen, in Python you _apply_ (or _use_, _call_) a function by typing its name followed by an open parenthesis '(', followed by the argument list, and finally a closing parenthesis ')'. In this section we will build our own functions. When you're writing your own function, this is preceded by the `def` keyword like so:\n",

    "    result = some + function * arguments \n",
    "    \n",
    "    return result \n",
    "```\n",
    "The final part of a function is `return` which specifies what the function evaluates to. This function has `3` arguments called `some`, `function`, and `arguments`. The string immediately after\n",
