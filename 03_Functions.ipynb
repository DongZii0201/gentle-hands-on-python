    "In the previous chapter we explored some of the _\"building blocks\"_ (the fundamental parts) of programming, this chapter introduces the _\"combining parts\"_ of programming. In order to build up the solution to a problem the building blocks are combined together into larger and larger forms until, finally, a useful whole is produced. This \"useful whole\" is what we call a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"combining parts\" of programs are called \"functions\". These are equivalent to mathematical functions but we will not use any more mathematical analogies here. Functions can be _defined_, _applied_ (or _used_, _called_), or _composed_. We will see examples of each in this chapter.\n",

As you've already seen, in Python you _apply_ a function by typing its name followed by an open parenthesis '(', followed by the argument list, and finally a closing parenthesis ')'. In this section we will build (or _define_) our own functions. When you're writing your own function, start with the _keyword_ `def` like so:\n",
