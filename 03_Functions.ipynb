    "> _\"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\"_<sup>1</sup>\n",

    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we explored some of the _\"building blocks\"_ (the fundamental parts) of programming, this chapter introduces the _\"combining parts\"_ of programming. In order to build up the solution to a problem the building blocks are combined together into larger and larger forms until, finally, a useful whole is produced. This \"useful whole\" is what we call a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Functions\n",
    "The \"combining parts\" of programs are called \"functions\". These are equivalent to mathematical functions but we will not use any more mathematical analogies here. Functions can be _defined_, _applied_ (or _used_, _called_), or _composed_. We will see examples of each in this chapter.\n",
    "Programs are also functions. They consume inputs (also known as arguments) and produce outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/191px-Function_machine2.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to a function can be a variety of things (some of which we've seen in the previous chapter), another function, a mouse press, a video stream, signals from a sensor, a file containing sequence data, ...\n",
    "A function _transforms_ its input to produce its output which can be combined with other functions to build up a whole program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been using some built-in Python functions, for example **abs()** or **len()**. As you've already seen, in Python you _apply_ a function by typing its name followed by an open parenthesis '(', followed by the argument list, and finally a closing parenthesis ')'. In this section we will build (or _define_) our own functions. When you're writing your own function, start with the _keyword_ `def` like so:\n",
    ":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def name_of_my_function(some, function, arguments):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Some information about the function\"\"\"\n",
    " \n",
    "    result = some + function * arguments \n",
    "    \n",
    "    return result \n",
    "```\n",
    "The final part of a function is `return` which specifies what the function evaluates to. This function has `3` arguments called `some`, `function`, and `arguments`. The string immediately after\n",
    "the definition is called the _docstring_ and is what the `help()` function prints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write our own function to compute the square of a number. This function takes a single numeric argument and returns that number squared."

    "_abstracting away_ details. Functions are a fundamentally important part of programming, indeed they're the other half of programming. Functions even correspond to mathematical proofs<sup>2</sup>! You have now covered _all_ of the very fundamentals of programming. You've understood the building blocks. And now you've understood the combining of things together using function definition, application, and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to programming then it is very likely this will seem overwhelming. Learning to program requires mastery of many new concepts. It is ok if you feel overwhelmed, the remaining chapters are here to help you practise. In some sense they are just more details of what we have already covered in the last 2 chapters<sup>3</sup>.\n",

    "    A <em>function</em> is a block of re-usable code with a name, that can be called using that name.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What is the result of evaluating a function called?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    The <em>return value</em>. Or the value <em>returned by the function</em>.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are docstrings? How to you access them?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    Docstrings are documentation that can be accessed using the <code>help()</code> function.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is meant by \"function application\", how is this different from \"function composition\"?\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "    Function application is synonymous with function \"call\" or \"use\". A function is applied to its arguments and evaluated to produce results. Function composition is the combining of several functions together to make a new \"thing\" that may be applied later.\n",
