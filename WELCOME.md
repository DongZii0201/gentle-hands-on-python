Dear Participant,

You are receiving this email because you registered for the course, Gentle Hands-on Introduction to Python. If you cannot attend, please reply to this email as soon as possible.

Welcome to the Gentle Hands-on Introduction to Python course for {{date}}! We are looking forward to seeing you online!
The same meeting link will be used for each of the 3 days beginning at 09:30 AM CEST (07:30 UTC): {{jitsi_link}}

You can access that link now to ensure it works for you. If not, we will have a backup stream via YouTube here:

  * Day 1: {{youtube_link_A}}
  * Day 2: {{youtube_link_B}}
  * Day 3: {{youtube_link_C}}

Though not required, it is useful to be able to use your microphone and webcam to ask questions. So please test these (if you have them)
with the meeting link before the course starts.

There are 4 things we request that you do in preperation for the course.

  1. Confirm your participation and help us tailor the course to your needs by completing
     a [short pre-course questionnaire](https://forms.vib.be/anon/#/forms/8482af4b-072a-4f8b-a062-2849b5b41ba7).
     Please complete this form as soon as possible. It should not take more than a few minutes. If you cannot attend, please respond to this
     email as soon as possible so that your place can be taken by someone on the long waiting list.
  2. Install software we will be using. A video tutorial is available via [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vLRAUHpeHtM).
      * [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
      * Python
          * [Windows]({{python_windows}})
          * [Apple OSX]({{python_osx}})
          * GNU/Linux: Install the appropriate package from your package manager
     If, for whatever reason, these options do not work for you then you can use your Google account to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
  3. Download the course materials from [here]({{release}}). Then unzip somewhere on your computer that is not a network drive.
  4. Use [this link]({{hedylink}}) to join the class on hedycode.com and create an account. For detailed instructions see: https://github.com/vibbits/gentle-hands-on-python#hedy

We look forward to programming with you soon. Until then, please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns.
