# Review

This concludes the introductory lesson. But there's one final idea to tell you about first.

## Comments

In their seminal book, _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_,[^1] Abelson and Sussman
claim that,

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

It is often the case that programs need explanation beyond the code you have typed out in order for
others (or even yourself) to understand them. This is what _commenting_ is for.

```python
# This is a comment
x is ask "What is x?" # This is also a comment
```

Comments are text that is ignored by the program interpreter so you can write whatever you like.
Sometimes it can even be useful to draw diagrams in comments!

```python
#       _
#      | |
#      | | __ _ _ __ ___   ___  ___
#  _   | |/ _` | '_ ` _ \ / _ \/ __|
# | |__| | (_| | | | | | |  __/\__ \
#  \____/ \__,_|_| |_| |_|\___||___/
```

## Fin

So far you have learned that programs are ordered sequences
of precise, formal instructions, somewhat like a recipe. You've hopefully noticed, thanks to Hedy,
that this can be fun. You discovered that you can print text, ask the user of your program to
enter text, "save" values into "variables", and use quote _syntax_ to distinguish literal text from
variables.

While exploring Hedy you probably got a taste of what you cat do with even simple programs. What did
you like about using Hedy? What couldn't you do that you would like to? Does programming seem less
intimidating after using Hedy?

You're welcome to continue to explore Hedy, it's a great way to gradually build concepts.
However, you will not use Hedy for this course. From now on you will be using the Python programming
language.
