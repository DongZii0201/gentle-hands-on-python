## Hedy

Hedy is a "gradual" programming language in that you will start with very simple programs and
Hedy will gradually introduce new concepts to you. In fact each "level" introduces new ideas and
commands. Today we will work through the first 4 levels of Hedy in order to understand the basics of
programming.

Within the Hedy interface you will find an area for writing program code:

A place for your program to display text:

In order to run the program that you type in, you can press the "Run Code" button:

Read the introductory description. Three commands are introduced: `print`, `ask`, and `echo`.
Using these three commands you can print text to the output area. Once you have tried writing
a program to print text to the output area with Hedy, explore some challenges in the tabs here:

Finally, once you have solved a few challenges and you feel comfortable with this level you can
move onto the next level by pressing this button:
