This exercise is not used to score you. Feel welcome to complete it on your own.

Write a function called `line_plot_global_data` that takes a single argument:
a list of global data observations. It should not return anything. In this function you should
use `matplotlib` draw a scatter plot from the input data. You can add labels with `xlabel()`, `ylabel()` and `title()` functions.

You can use the documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html),
and the plot gallery [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/)

When drawing this plot, your result should look like this:

<img src="media/plot-output.png" alt="Scatter plot output" style="width:80;height:auto">


Experiment with adding and changing line colours with the `color` parameter.
