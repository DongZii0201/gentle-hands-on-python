## Data Types

Using Hedy, you were able to `print` text to the program output area.
You even discovered a special syntax for writing literal text in your programs: you
surrounded the text with quotation marks (`"`). Programmers refer to text between quotation
marks as _strings_. In fact, Python shortens this name to simply `str`. `str` is a  _data type_,
all strings are the type, `str`. As you will discover throughout this course, Python has
a rich set of _data types_ that are useful when writing programs. But first, let us try to
understand why thinking about data types is useful.
