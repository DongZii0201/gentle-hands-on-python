# Review

Congratulations! By now you understand enough Python to tackle complex and interesting problems.
Hopefully you noticed the exercises are becoming more interesting. Keep practicing and your
confidence and ability to solve problems can only improve.

In this chapter you've learned how to ask the computer to repeat a block of code for you using
a `for`-each loop. You also learned about 2 useful built-in functions: `range()`, `sum()`.

## Review Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why is looping useful?</summary>
  Manually repeating computations is tedious and error prone. Try not to repeat yourself, computers are much better at it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a <code>for</code>-each loop used for?</summary>
  Repeating operations on each element of a list.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is <code>range()</code> used for?</summary>
  Save us typing out a range of numbers. A <em>range</em> has a given start point, to a given end point, and uses a given step size.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What operation **cannot** be performed in the body (indented block) of a <code>for</code>-each loop?</summary>
  None! All Python operations can be performed in a loop body. But <b>be careful</b> when you mofify the list you're looping over. Unexpected things can happen!
