# Introduction

Welcome. Learning how to write programs is a daunting but extremely useful skill and you've all
taken the first step. It will be a long journey but you will soon notice that the skills you
acquire along the way can already be put to good use. This course is designed as an introduction
to programming for those with no experience at all. We happen to use the Python language but the skills
you aquire will be useful with a broad range of languages. Python itself is often used broadly
in biological research and bioinformatics so it it likely to be directly applicable to your work.
We do not expect you to be able to weild Python independently after this course, but have a solid
foundation from which to continue learning and applying your new skills.
