Welcome!

Learning how to write programs is a daunting but extremely useful skill and you've
taken the first step. It will be a long journey but you will soon notice that the skills you
acquire along the way can already be put to good use. This course is designed as an introduction
to programming for those with no experience at all. We happen to use the Python language but the skills
you acquire will be useful with a broad range of languages. Python itself is often used broadly
in biological research and bio-informatics so it is likely to be directly applicable to your work.
We do not expect you to be able to wield Python independently after this course, but have a solid
foundation from which to continue learning and applying your new skills.


## Who is this course for?

This is a self-paced course that gently introduces programming to new programmers. You will need a lot
of self-motivation and determination. I'm afraid the bad news is that programming is hard. There is
a lot to learn and a short course like this will not make you a professional programmer.

The good news is that you don't need to know everything in order to be useful. In fact you can write
useful programs with very little knowledge. This is the place where we are trying to get you during
this course: confident enough in your own skills and ability to learn that you can write or edit
useful programs.

This course provides you with plenty of opportunities to practice what you learn and to ask questions
in a safe place. You will even surprise yourself by building a substantial project on your own!

## What is covered?

This course covers the very basics, it's a starting point for your adventures into programming.

You will start off with concepts such as:

 - What is computation and programming
 - How to think like a programmer
 - Fundamentals: values, variables, and functions
 - Correctness with types, testing, and documentation
 
When you are more confident we will more advanced practicalities:

 - Decision making
 - Operating on collections of data
 - Loops and repetition over collections of data
 - Input and output
 - Plotting and visualising data

## What is not covered?

This course is an introduction to programming, not an introduction to Python. We do use Python
as a teaching language but that is only incidental. We expect that you will be able to take what
you learn in this course and apply it to learning any language.

As such, many details about Python are ignored. Python is a big and complicated industrial language
that no-one could hope to learn in detail in a short course. Instead, you can use this course as
a foundation for learning Python (or any other language) or for improving your understanding of
the language of your choice.

The fundamental message is this: you can do it.
