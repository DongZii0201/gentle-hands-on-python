Values are passed as function arguments, not (variable) names. This can sometimes be confusing
so let's check your understanding.

In this exercise, your task is to evaluate some Python code in your head. Here's the code:

```python
a = len("Hello")
b = "bl" + "ob"
c = len(b) + a
d = my_square(len(b))
```

Here is the definition of `my_square` from the previous section so you don't have to go back and find 
it:

```python
def my_square(number: int) -> int:
  return number ** 2
```

In the script below you should write the results of evaluating these expressions in your head. For
example, here is my (wrong) answer:

```python
a = "James"
b = 42
c = 12
d = 101
```
